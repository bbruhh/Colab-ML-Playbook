We will train a *logistic regression* model that, given an individual's information, outputs a number between 0 and 1â€”this can be interpreted as the probability that the individual has an annual income of over 50,000 dollars.\n","\n","Key Point: As a modeler and developer, think about how this data is used and the potential benefits and harm a model's predictions can cause. A model like this could reinforce societal biases and disparities. Is each  feature relevant to the problem you want to solve or will it introduce bias?
